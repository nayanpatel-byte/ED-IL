
BACKEND CHANGES (app.py)
The internship_listings route was enhanced to handle comprehensive search and filter parameters from the frontend. The route now accepts search queries, skill filters, location filters, duration filters, and sorting options as URL parameters. When a user searches for "AI" or selects "Python" from the skills dropdown, the backend filters the internships accordingly. The search functionality checks for matches in the internship title, company name, and required skills. New location filtering supports Remote, On-site, and Hybrid work arrangements. Duration filtering categorizes internships into 1-3 months, 3-6 months, and 6+ months ranges. The route also supports sorting by most recent, company name, or title, and returns the filtered results along with all current filter parameters to maintain the user's selections.

DATABASE CHANGES (data.json)
The database was expanded from 3 to 23 internships by adding 20 new diverse internship opportunities. These new internships cover various technology fields including AI/ML Engineering, Data Science, Frontend Development, Cloud Engineering, Mobile App Development, Game Development, Cybersecurity, IoT Development, VR/AR Development, Fintech, Environmental Data Analysis, Healthcare AI, EdTech Development, Autonomous Vehicle Development, Quantum Computing, and Aerospace Engineering. Each internship entry includes the company name, job title, required skills list, work location, duration, number of openings, and creation timestamp. Sample internships now include location and duration data to demonstrate the new filtering capabilities.

FRONTEND CHANGES (templates/internship_listings.html)
The template was completely restructured to display dynamic content instead of static placeholder data. The search input box was made functional with an onkeyup event handler that triggers filtering as users type. A three-column filter layout was implemented with location, duration, and skills dropdowns. The skills dropdown was expanded to include 11 programming skills: Python, JavaScript, Java, SQL, AI, React, AWS, Unity, Machine Learning, Blockchain, and Cybersecurity. The location filter supports Remote, On-site, and Hybrid work arrangements. The duration filter categorizes internships into 1-3 months, 3-6 months, and 6+ months ranges. The internship cards now display real data from the database including actual company names, job titles, required skills, and application counts. The results counter shows the actual number of internships found, and the apply buttons are functional with AJAX calls to the backend.

FUNCTIONALITY ADDED
Users can now search for internships by typing keywords that match job titles, company names, or required skills. The skills dropdown allows filtering by specific programming languages or technologies. New location filtering enables users to find Remote, On-site, or Hybrid internships. Duration filtering helps users find internships that match their availability with 1-3 months, 3-6 months, or 6+ months options. Three sorting options are available: most recent, company name, and title. All filtering happens in real-time and updates the URL parameters so users can bookmark or share filtered results. The apply functionality includes proper success and error feedback, and the page displays a message when no internships match the search criteria.

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS
The frontend and backend are now properly connected with the filtering logic working seamlessly. AJAX requests include proper error handling for various scenarios like network failures or server errors. The existing Bootstrap styling and layout were maintained while adding the new functionality. All changes were kept minimal and focused on core features without unnecessary complexity. File corruption issues were resolved by cleaning up duplicate content and ensuring proper template structure.
